# Text-to-Speech (TTS) with Hugging Face Transformers

The Text-to-Speech (TTS) with Hugging Face Transformers project demonstrates the generation of high-quality audio from input text using pre-trained TTS models. By leveraging Hugging Face's Transformers library, this project enables users to convert textual content into natural-sounding speech with various voice presets.

## Key Features

- Incorporation of a pre-trained Text-to-Speech (TTS) model from the Hugging Face Transformers library to convert input text into audio.
- Processing of text using the model's tokenizer to convert it into numerical tokens suitable for model inference.
- Generation of natural-sounding speech based on the input text, with customizable voice presets.
- Saving generated audio samples as WAV files for easy storage and sharing.

## Applications

- Enhancing accessibility for individuals with visual impairments by converting text content into speech.
- Multimedia Content
- Virtual Assistants
- Language Learning
